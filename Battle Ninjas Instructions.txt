Battle Ninjas Instructions:


* You are a ninja trying to protect your village wall from waves of enemy ninjas.

* If your village wall is destroyed, it’s game over.

* Use the W/A/S/D keys to move in any direction, and press G to throw a shuriken.

* Avoid enemy shurikens while defeating enemies. If your health bar runs out, it’s game over.

* If you defeat all of the enemies in a wave, the boss battle for that wave will begin.

* In a boss battle, use the W/D keys to move side-to-side, and press the SPACEBAR to jump. Press G to throw a shuriken.

* Once a boss is defeated, the next wave will start.

* If you complete all 4 waves and bosses without your health bar running out or your wall breaking, you win!
